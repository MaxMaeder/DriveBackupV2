# Plugin translations

As users contribute translations of the plugin's `intl.yml`, they will appear here. Simply download a translation file, rename it to `intl.yml`, and place it in the plugin's folder on your Minecraft server.

## Contributing

Make a pull request with changes an existing translation, or add a new translation. Name any new translations files using the following format: `<language-code>.intl` (for example `es.intl`).

Please don't add an English translation, that is already in the default `intl.yml`.
