# Expandable list of things to back up.
backup-list:
# The backup list is comprised of three things:
#   - folder names
#   - file name formats
#   - whether this plugin should create the backup
# The file name format is what the backup's naming scheme is
# For more information about timedate formatting, see
#   http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html
# Correct formatting is important, as this is how the plugin knows
#   which backup is the most recent!
#
# For example, if you wanted to back up crash reports, you would do:
#  crash-reports:
#    format: "'crash-'yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss'-server.zip'"
#    create: true
# The 'crash-reports:' part refers to the folder, and the "'crash-'yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss'-server.txt'" refers to
#   what format the file name is. Since create is set to true, the plugin will take the crash-reports folder,
#   zip it into a file according to the format, and upload it.
# You can also use the blacklist key to not include specified files
#    blacklist:
#    - "dontbackup"
#    - "thesefolders"
#    - "orthisfile.txt"
